Thanks for the screenshot! It looks like you're viewing the **"Forks" tab** _after_ you've already forked the repository. That's why it's showing analytics like Pulse, Contributors, Network, etc.

### Here's what probably happened:
- You already **clicked Fork** earlier, so now you're in your own forked repo (`123sailee/sanjivani_de...`).
- That's perfect — step 1 is already done!

### Now continue with the next steps:

1. **Clone your fork (on your PC or termux):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/123sailee/sanjivani_de...git
cd sanjivani_de...
```

2. **Create a new branch:**
```bash
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

3. **Make your changes**, then:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added feature or fixed bug"
git push origin my-feature-branch
```

4. **Open Pull Request:**
- Go to your repo on GitHub (`123sailee/sanjivani_de...`)
- You’ll see a **“Compare & pull request”** button — click it.
- Confirm the base repo and branch, write a message, and **Create Pull Request**.

If you want me to help you write the command for a specific change or commit message, just say the word.
